This is one of our favorite dishes to get when going to a Korean restaurant… but it’s always so dang expensive! I realized that the recipe is super simple and can be very cheap! If you have local Chinese supermarkets, you can get the same cuts of meat for a fraction of the price!

In an Asian supermarket, you can ask the butcher to cut it thinly. The slices should be about a third or a half inch thick. I’ve found that this comes out to ~$4lb or $5/lb in a Chinese supermarket versus the $15/lb in a Korean supermarket. Your experience may vary depending on where you’re from (I’m in NYC).
