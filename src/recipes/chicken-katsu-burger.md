    Tip: Thin-sliced chicken will work better and cook more easily. Use a meat-pounder to tenderize or flatten it if the slices are too thick.

    #### Setting up the breading stations
    Breading your chicken requires 3 containers or bowls:
    1. Flour: mix the flour, corn starch, paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper
    2. Egg wash
    3. Breadcrumbs

    Bread your chicken by designating a dry-hand and a wet-hand. The dry hand will only touch the meat while it is in the flour or bread crumbs container, and the wet-hand will only touch the meat while it is in the egg wash. Coat the meat in the flour, then the egg wash, then the bread crumbs.

    #### Making the coleslaw
    Mix together your cabbage, carrots, greek yogurt, and mustard. Add 1 tbsp of mayo, leaving a remaining 1 tbsp for the sriracha-mayo sauce.

    #### Making the spicy mayo
    Spicy mayo is super simple. Mix the mayonnaise with sriracha. Add more or less sriracha depending on your spicy preference.

    #### Frying the katsu
    1. Heat oil to 375F
    2. Drop in your breaded chicken lightly to avoid splashing. Fry until it's golden brown but not burnt. This should be around 7-10 minutes, but heavily depends on your chicken's thickness.
    3. Remove the chicken from the oil, and let it rest for 5 minutes on a paper towel. This will help remove the excess oil.

    #### Compile your burger
    * Spread spicy mayo to cover the bottom bun.
    * Add coleslaw.
    * Add the fried chicken katsu.
    * Optional: add more spicy mayo on top of the katsu.
    * Add the top bun, and you're done!
