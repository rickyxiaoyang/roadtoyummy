    - name: "Pre-cook the pork"
      steps:
        - text: "Boil a pot of water and submerge the pork belly. Let it boil for 5 minutes and skim any excess scum off the water."
        - text: "Take out the pork and place into an ice bath to stop the cooking."
    - name: "Dry out the pork"
      steps:
        - text: "Your goal here is to dry it out as much as possible. Remove the pork from the ice bath and wrap it with paper towels."
        - text: "Pat the pork until it's as dry as possible."
        - text: "If you have a meat tenderizer that can puncture holes into the meat, use it here. If you do not have one, feel free to use a fork. Make sure to puncture deep enough for the skin to leak out, but NOT deep to the point that it has a huge hole. \n\nThese holes will help the fat escape to the skin, which will aid in the crisping process. The more holes, the better."
    - name: "Apply the rub"
      steps:
        - text: "Mix together the salt, sugar, white pepper, and five spice powder together. Mix well."
        - text: "Using this rub mixture, apply it on all sides of the pork EXCEPT the skin."
        - text: "This next step will call on your arts-and-craft skills. You're going to make an aluminum casing for the pork belly, only exposing it's skin. \n\nDo this by folding sides of the aluminum foil and pinch the sides together."
    - name: "Dry it out even more!"
      steps:
        - text: "Lightly add salt on top of the skin. This will help extract the moisture out of the skin. Place into your fridge uncovered. This should be in your fridge overnight."
        - text: "Periodically, you may wipe the skin with a paper towel to soak up the excess moisture. You can also brush some rice vinegar on the skin. This will help dry it out as well. \n\nRemember to add a bit more salt if some end up being removed."
    - name: "Air-frying the pork"
      steps:
        - text: "Your long-awaited time is here! Your pork should feel very dry to the touch."
        - text: "Pre-heat your air-fryer to 400. Place the pork belly in for 25 minutes. You can adjust accordingly, depending on the strength of your air fryer. \n\nI recommend checking at the 15 minutes, at which point you should be able to see the crackling skin forming."
        - text: "Once your time is up, take it out and cut! I recommend using a cleaver to cut. Remember to place your pork sideways or upside-down. "
        - text: "Serve your delicious pork with a side of cabbage or bokchoy, and rice! We love to dip the pork in hoisin sauce, which adds a nice sweetness to the pork."
        - text: "Enjoy!"
